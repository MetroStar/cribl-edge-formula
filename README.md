# cribl-edge-formula
This Salt formula will install and configure the [Crible-Edge](https://docs.cribl.io/edge/about/) agent. It is expected that this automation will be executed as part of a larger SaltStack execution such as that performed when running [Watchmaker](https://watchmaker.readthedocs.io/).
